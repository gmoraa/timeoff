## Application Requirements
* Timeoff-management fork on local repository.
* Application must be deployed using a fully automated continuous integration solution based on Jenkins, triggered by a change in source control.
* Artifact management to be done through an artifact repository management solution.
* Required infrastructure running on virtualization solution or preference, provisioned using some sort of infrastructure as code through configuration management.Â 

## Version 
1.0.0

## Requirements

*Ansible      (2.9.7)
*VirtualBox   (6.1.14)
*Vagrant      (2.2.10)
*macOS        (Catalina 10.15.6)

This should also work on any Linux distribution but has not been tested.

## Usage
ansible-playbook -i ./inventory main .yml

## Software Architecture
Given the requirements listed above I created all the components as code, that means ansible execution will create 3 Docker containers and 1 virtual machine running Ubuntu. 

Behind this logic there is a reason, connecting a local environment to a cloud environment could generate too much chaos. Think about connecting Github in the cloud to a local Jenkins for Continuos Integration or a Jenkins in the Cloud to a local virtual machine for the Continuous Deployment, it's for that reason this architecture involves all 4 applications locally.

Ansible has two steps in this process:

  1) Call Vagrant to generate the 4 applications, 3 of these are Docker containers and the last one is a Ubuntu machine.
  2) Configure the Ubuntu machine with the application, git clone, npm install and npm start.

## To improve
The connectivity(webhook) between GitLab and Jenkins is missing as code aswell as the Groovy file for Jenkins to detect the changes in the code.
